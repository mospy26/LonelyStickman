The style of this project is based off the Google C++ style (https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html) with the following variations:

1. The base indentation is 4 spaces.
2. Global variables start with "g_", typedefs with "t_", and member variables with "m_".
3. Instead of prepending a constant variable name with "k", they will be in UPPER CASE like in the C style
4. camelCase is used instead of snake_case
5. Curly braces open in next line for functions, classes, enums or structs. For conditional flow and loops, they open in line!
 //explicit must be used for single arguments
